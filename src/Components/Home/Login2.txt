Subject: Request for Emergency Leave Due to health issue 


I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you about a sudden and serious health issue that I am currently facing. Unfortunately, I have been diagnosed with a severe stomach disease, and my medical condition has worsened over the past few days.

 However, my health has deteriorated to the point where I am unable to perform my duties effectively. My doctors have strongly advised that I take immediate medical leave to undergo treatment and recover.

Attached to this email, you will find a copy of my medical report, which provides details of my diagnosis and the recommended treatment plan. I assure you that I did not take this decision lightly, and I am committed to minimizing any disruption to the project during my absence. I am willing to provide any assistance necessary to ensure a smooth transition of my responsibilities to a colleague or team member. Additionally, I will keep you updated on my progress and expected duration of the medical leave.

I kindly request your understanding and support during this challenging time. If you require any further information or have specific instructions regarding the project while I am on leave, please do not hesitate to reach out to me via email or phone.

I apologize for any inconvenience my absence may cause and will make every effort to return to work as soon as I am medically fit to do so.

Thank you for your understanding and consideration.

Sincerely,

Sumit Kumar
